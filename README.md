# Steven's Tip Calculator
## What It Is
This is a simple tool to calculate tips when you're eating out. It helps you figure out how much tip to leave based on your bill.
## Why It's Made
The goal is to make tipping easy:
- If your bill is between $50 and $300, it calculates a 15% tip.
- For anything else, it calculates a 20% tip.
## How to Use It
Just enter your bill amount, and it'll tell you:
- Your bill
- The tip amount
- Your total (bill + tip)
